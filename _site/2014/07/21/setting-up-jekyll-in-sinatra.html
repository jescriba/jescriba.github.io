<meta name="description" content="My main website was built using Sinatra, but I wanted a way to generate and manage content for a blog using the popular Jekyll static site generator. First, I did a bit of quick digging and found some great tutorials and themes for using Jekyll. I used Poole to provide a lot of the boiler plate code behind setting up the blog which included some nice styling themes like Lanyon. However, I had to do some minor tweaking to get Poole and Jekyll integrated within Sinatra. Namely, Sinatra handles most portions of the site and routing while I wanted Jekyll to handle the creation and styling of the blog portion. The main changes I made were in the default routing of the basic jekyll skeleton. This consisted of changing the appropriate routes in layout and in _config.yml to use the /blog/ base url. I also took a brute force route for serving the static files by writing a build script that would copy the generated html to the /views directory of my Sinatra app and copy the stylesheets to the default /public route that Sinatra checks. Finally, I had to edit my main.rb file to match the appropriate url requests to the appropriate blog posts. To solve that, I wrote a basic method that would grab the path and match it to the appropriate blog post path and copy the html files to erb files to have Sinatra render them. I took this approach because I use Heroku to deploy my site and heroku does not support the use of Rack::Sendfile. I believe that Sinatra would otherwise need Sendfile to serve html directly which is why I copy the files to the erb format - arbitrarily… Easy enough. get &#39;/blog/?*&#39; do get_blog(request.path) end def get_blog(path) path.gsub!(&#39;/blog&#39;, &#39;&#39;) path = path + &quot;/&quot; + &#39;index&#39; if File.exists?(&quot;./views/blog/&quot; + path + &#39;.html&#39;) dir_path = &quot;./views/blog&quot; + path FileUtils.cp(dir_path + &#39;.html&#39;, dir_path + &#39;.erb&#39;) erb :&quot;blog/#{path}&quot;, :layout =&gt; false else erb :not_found end end" />
